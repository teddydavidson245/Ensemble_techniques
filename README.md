Background and Context
For a tourism company named "Visit with us", The Policy Maker of the company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base.

A viable business model is a central concept that helps you to understand the existing ways of doing the business and how to change the ways for the benefit of the tourism sector.

One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages.

Wellness Tourism is defined as Travel that allows the traveler to maintain, enhance or kick-start a healthy lifestyle, and support or increase one's sense of well-being, and wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to make the marketing expenditure more efficient.
